Python is an easy to understand and learn programming language and has a lot of libraries which we can import to perform endless tasks like machine learning, data science and implement AI models. It is also free to use and is open source which gives it a little advantage over other programming languages.\n"

    "\n",
    "Ans. Tuples and lists are data structures in Python used to store collections of items. The key difference between them lies in their mutability. Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation, while lists are mutable, allowing for modification of elements. Tuples are defined using parentheses, and once created, their size and content remain fixed. Lists, defined with square brackets, can grow or shrink as needed. Tuples are memory-efficient and have slightly better performance due to their immutability. Lists are commonly used for dynamic collections that require modifications, while tuples are preferred for fixed collections with constant elements.\n",

    "int: Represents integer numbers without decimal points.\n",
    "float: Represents floating-point numbers with decimal points.\n",

    "\n",
    "bool: Represents boolean values True or False.\n",

    "3.Sequence Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "str: Represents strings of characters, which are immutable sequences of Unicode characters.\n",
    "list: Represents ordered, mutable sequences of elements. Lists are enclosed in square brackets [].\n",
    "tuple: Represents ordered, immutable sequences of elements. Tuples are enclosed in parentheses ().\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Set Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "set: Represents an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are enclosed in curly braces {}.\n",

    "\n",
    "5.Mapping Type:\n",
    "\n",
    "dict: Represents associative arrays or dictionaries, consisting of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces {} and have keys and corresponding values separated by colons :\n",
    "\n",
    "6.None Type:\n",

    "None: Represents the absence of a value, similar to null in other programming languages. It is often used to indicate that a variable has no value or has not been initialized."

    "CNN consists of an input image, that goes through optional padding. Then several rounds (as required) of convolution, and pooling happen along with filters, to produce a fully connected layer. Then the output produced is flattened. This flattened image is used as input to the fully connected layer to produce a final output which could be a classification of the original image."

    "Q22. What is the use of activation function and optimizers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Activation Function: Activation functions are used in neural networks to introduce non-linearity to the model. They decide whether a neuron should be activated (fired) or not based on the input. Activation functions help the neural network learn complex patterns and relationships in the data, making it capable of solving more sophisticated problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizers: Optimizers are algorithms used in training neural networks to minimize the error and improve the model's performance. They adjust the model's parameters (weights and biases) during the training process to find the best combination that minimizes the difference between predicted and actual values. Optimizers play a vital role in speeding up convergence and ensuring the neural network learns efficiently. They help in finding the global or local minimum of the loss function, which indicates the best possible fit for the data."

    "\n",
    "Ans. In short and simple words:\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared (R²) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables in a regression model. It tells us how well the model fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared (adjusted R²) is a modification of R-squared that accounts for the number of independent variables in the model. It penalizes the addition of unnecessary variables, helping to prevent overfitting. Adjusted R-squared increases only if the additional variable improves the model more than would be expected by chance. It provides a more accurate assessment of the model's goodness of fit when there are multiple independent variables."

    "\n",
    "Ans.LSTM stands for Long Short-Term Memory, and it is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture. In simple words, LSTM is designed to handle long sequences of data and retain important information over time. It is particularly useful for tasks that involve analyzing and making predictions based on sequences of data, such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series forecasting. LSTM's unique design allows it to effectively capture dependencies and patterns in sequential data, making it a powerful tool for handling time-based information in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications"
