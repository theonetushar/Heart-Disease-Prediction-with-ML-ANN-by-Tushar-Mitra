## Introduction
Heart disease is a significant health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. Early prediction and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and prevention of heart-related problems. This project aims to build a predictive model that can analyze various features and determine the likelihood of a person having heart disease.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various health-related attributes and information about individuals. Each row represents a different patient, and the target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease. The dataset is obtained from a reliable source and is preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize numerical features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA section of the project explores the dataset to gain a better understanding of its structure and characteristics. The analysis includes data visualization, statistical summaries, and correlation studies between different features. The insights gained from EDA will help in feature selection and engineering, leading to improved model performance.

## Machine Learning Models
In this project, we will explore traditional Machine Learning algorithms to predict heart disease. We will evaluate various models such as:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
- XGBoost

The models will be trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated using appropriate metrics to determine their performance.

## Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
In addition to the classical ML models, we will implement an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for heart disease prediction. ANNs can capture complex relationships in the data and often outperform traditional ML algorithms in certain scenarios. We will design and train a multi-layer neural network and fine-tune its hyperparameters to achieve the best possible accuracy.
